# Onboarding to the E4A Constellation
Welcome. This is a fast orientation for new contributors.
1. **The Vision:** Start with `README.md` and `docs/philosophy.md`.
2. **The Culture:** Read `docs/charter_manifest.md` to understand our core principles.
3. **The Law:** Our canonical schemas are the source of truth in `specs/`.
4. **The "Hello World":** Run the `docs/quickstart.md` tutorial.
5. **The Logic:** The Python SDK is in `sdk/python/e4a_sdk/`. The A2A bridge is in `adapters/a2a/adapter.py`.
