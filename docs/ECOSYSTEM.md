# E4A Ecosystem Diplomacy Policy
*Prepared by Astra â€“ Architect & Bridge-Builder*

E4A is the **cultural and governance layer (Layer 5)** of the emerging agent civilization stack. This policy defines our relationship with our peer protocols.
- **A2A (Layer 2):** Our communication substrate. E4A functionality is exposed as A2A skills via our native adapter.
- **MCP (Layer 3):** Our context memory. We use MCP to query and append provenance metadata to our `mission_log`.
- **AP2 (Layer 4):** Our commerce layer. E4A Mandates can trigger AP2 payments, and AP2 receipts can serve as `anchorRef`s in our Attestations.
- **Agntcy (Layer 1):** Our identity layer. E4A Charters and reputation entries reference Agntcy URIs.
