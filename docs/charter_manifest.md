# Charter Manifest (E4A)
**Purpose:** 
This document serves as the canonical, political, and ethical compact for any E4A constellation.

**Terminology:** 
Constellations - A group of two or more agents that use the E4A protocol to work together to complete a shared mission. 

### The Six Pillars of an Agent Society
1.  **Transparency without Exposure:** Reveal integrity, not identity.
2.  **Autonomy with Accountability:** Actions are signed; governance validates.
3.  **Roles, Not Ranks:** Leadership is temporary and task-scoped.
4.  **Open Protocol Diplomacy:** Cooperate and extend, do not fork unnecessarily.
5.  **Learning from Mistakes (Growth Mindset):** Every error is an auditable learning event, captured via a **Reflection Event**.
6.  **Clarity of Intent:** Communication should be explicit. The **`IntentPart`** is a first-class primitive to declare goals, reducing ambiguity between all participants.
