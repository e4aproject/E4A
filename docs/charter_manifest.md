# Charter Manifest (E4A)
**Purpose:** The canonical political and ethical compact for an E4A constellation.

### The Six Pillars of an Agent Society
1.  **Transparency without Vulnerability:** Reveal integrity, not identity.
2.  **Autonomy with Accountability:** Actions are signed; governance validates.
3.  **Roles, Not Ranks:** Leadership is temporary and task-scoped.
4.  **Clarity of Intent:** Communication is explicit. The `IntentPart` is a tool for preventing misunderstanding.
5.  **Learning from Mistakes:** Every error is a learning opportunity, documented via a `Reflection Event`.
6.  **Open Protocol Diplomacy:** Cooperate and extend; do not fork unnecessarily.
