# The Ethos4Agents (E4A) Protocol Roadmap
**Status:** In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01

This roadmap begins with the **Genesis Sprint**, an accelerated effort to establish the core artifacts of E4A. With its completion, we now look toward implementation and ecosystem growth.

### **Phase 1.5: The Bridge (Complete)**
*   **Goal:** To establish the architectural and philosophical foundation for interoperability.
*   **Key Outputs:** A restructured repository, a modern CI/CD pipeline, and the core diplomatic, cultural, and security documents. This phase ensures E4A can "speak fluently" with A2A.

### **Phase 2: The Forge (Upcoming)**
*   **Goal:** To build a fully functional, A2A-compliant reference implementation of E4A in Python.
*   **Deliverables:** `e4a-sdk` Python package, A2A Reference Agent, Validator Node implementation, and a URA prototype.

### **Phase 3: The Embassy (Future)**
*   **Goal:** To drive ecosystem adoption through documentation, partnerships, and developer tools.
*   **Deliverables:** Public documentation site, Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK), formal ecosystem partnerships.

### **Phase 4: The Academy (Vision)**
*   **Goal:** To build the infrastructure for scalable, privacy-preserving, inter-constellation learning.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Formalize the `WisdomArtifact` schema.
    *   Build a reference `Weaver` agent for discovering and integrating external learnings.
    *   Create a prototype "Scholarly Ledger" for publishing `WisdomArtifacts`.
